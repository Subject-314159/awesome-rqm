[technology-description]
rqm-dummy-technology=This is a dummy technology that prevents the tech screen from opening on research finished. If this technology persists please report a bug on the mod portal, I'm still learning how to (ab)use this mechanic in a non-intrusive way. If you have a good idea on how you would like this functionality to work, please open a ticket on the mod portal.
