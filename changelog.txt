Version: 0.2.0
Date: 3-8-2025
  Minor Features:
    - Added option to hide infinite technology
  Bugfixes:
    - Option for hiding "hidden" tech now actually hides the tech
    - Make removal of dummy tech in the queue more robust
    - Make really long technology names not have the full pane scrolling but just that text area by adding a scroll bar just for the text area and while this is not a permanent or perfect solution at least it is a containment for the problem that the add to queue buttons are being pushed too far to the right which makes it really inconvenient to queue new tech
