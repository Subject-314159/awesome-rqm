# AwesomeRQM

One research queue manager to rule them all! The days of endless searching for all required technologies are gone. No more frustration why you can't seem to find the research that unlocks your favorite recipes.

During development the most critical issues have been solved, though be aware that edge cases have not been covered.

# Known issues

- Potentially not multiplayer safe
- Manually interacting with the in-game queue messes up the RQM scheduler

### Compatibility issues

- Mods that fake a "parallel" research functionality do nasty stuff to the in-game research queue
- Other auto-research mods may fight over the research queue with our mod
- Mods that also use the default keybind (Alt + Shift + T) may fight over the keybind
