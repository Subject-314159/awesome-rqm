# AwesomeRQM

One research queue manager to rule them all! The days of endless searching for all required technologies are gone. No more frustration why you can't seem to find the research that unlocks your favorite recipes.

_This mod is in early alpha stage!_

During development the most critical issues have been solved, though be aware that edge cases have not been covered.

# Known issues

-   No known critical issues that causes crashes, feel free to open a bug report when you encounter one!
-   Announcements of infinite tech does not include the current/new level
-   If a research is finished within 3 ticks of scheduling we might not be able to intercept the technology screen
-   A lot is still to be improved, so hang tight for future updates!

### Compatibility issues

-   Mods that fake a "parallel" research functionality do nasty stuff to the in-game research queue
-   Other auto-research mods may fight over the research queue with our mod
-   Mods that also use the default keybind (Alt + Shift + T) may fight over the keybind
